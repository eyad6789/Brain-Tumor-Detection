## Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI scan images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. Accurate and early detection of brain tumors is a crucial step in the treatment process, and this project demonstrates a deep learning approach for automated classification.
